How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? I use effective quality assurance methods. This includes reverse engineering with assembly and
binary code, as well as writing professional JUnit tests. I am confident my JUnit tests implmented in the attached .java file(s) (CS320_Project.zip) have a specific goal to properly
diagnose and test the program's output/results, EXACTLY how the customer requested.

Having a great leader and SCRUM team that is very interactive with the customer is extremely helpful in making the requirements very clear. It is me and my team's goal to deliver
a working product to our clients, on time!
